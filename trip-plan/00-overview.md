## Car Rental

**A rental car is essential on Maui.** Public transit is minimal and impractical with a child.

- **Book ASAP** — February is peak season, prices and availability tighten
- **Pickup:** Kahului Airport (OGG), walkable rental car facility
- **Estimated cost:** $80-130/day for a midsize car (~$600-900/week)
- **Gas:** Fill up at **Costco Kahului** — cheapest on the island (~$0.30-0.50/gal less than resort-area stations)
- **Eldorado parking:** Free
- **Tip:** Check if your rental agreement allows the unpaved back-road section of the Road to Hana (past Hana toward Kaupo). Most standard rentals prohibit it.

**Drive times from Ka'anapali Eldorado:**

## What to Pack

### Beach Essentials
- **Reef-safe mineral sunscreen** (zinc oxide / titanium dioxide only) — Hawaii law bans oxybenzone & octinoxate; Maui County also bans avobenzone & octocrylene. Buy before you go or at Costco Kahului.
- Rash guards / UV shirts for the whole family (best sun protection + reduces sunscreen needs)
- Reef shoes / water shoes (for rocky snorkel entries)
- Snorkel gear — buy at Costco Kahului (~$25-40/set) or rent from Snorkel Bob's (locations in Lahaina & Kihei, ~$10-15/day)
- Waterproof phone case
- Beach towels (Eldorado provides towels at the cabana, but bring extras for day trips)
- Binoculars for whale watching from shore

### Clothing
- Lightweight, breathable clothes (shorts, t-shirts, sundresses)
- Swimsuits (bring 2-3 so one can dry)
- Light rain jacket or windbreaker
- **Warm layers for Haleakala summit** — fleece jacket, beanie, gloves, warm pants. It's 30-40°F up there! Bring a blanket too.
- Comfortable walking shoes (for Road to Hana hikes and Haleakala)
- Flip flops / sandals

### Health & Comfort
- Motion sickness medication — Road to Hana has 620 curves; boat rides can be rocky
- Aloe vera gel (for sunburn, just in case)
- Insect repellent (mosquitoes near streams/waterfalls)
- Reusable water bottles
- First aid kit basics

### Other
- Daypack/backpack for hikes
- Cooler bag + ice packs (for beach snacks and Road to Hana day)
- Car phone mount (essential for navigation)

## 🚗 Bad Weather Driving Tips

### Your Route: OGG Airport → Costco → Highway 30 → Ka'anapali

**Total distance:** ~27 miles, normally 45 min (plan 60-75 min in storm conditions)

### Flash Flood Risk Areas — What to Watch For:

**🔴 HIGH RISK: Ma'alaea Harbor Area (Mile 7-9 of your drive)**
- **Location:** About halfway between Kahului and Lahaina
- **Why it floods:** Sea-level coastal area where West Maui Mountain runoff meets the ocean
- **Visual cues:** Brown/muddy water flowing across road, Ma'alaea Harbor Shops visible on your right
- **Action:** If you see standing water on the highway:
  - SLOW DOWN to 15-20 mph
  - If water is more than 4-6 inches deep (covers half the wheel), **STOP and wait** for it to drain
  - **Never drive through moving/flowing water**
  - Pull into Ma'alaea Harbor Shops parking lot to wait if needed

**🟡 MODERATE RISK: McGregor Point Area (Mile 9-11)**
- **Location:** Just north of Ma'alaea, famous whale-watching lookout point
- **Why it floods:** Exposed coastal section, waves can wash over road during storms
- **Visual cues:** Ocean spray hitting the highway from the right, waves crashing onto pavement
- **Action:** Drive in the left lane, away from ocean. Slow to 30-35 mph.

**🟡 MODERATE RISK: Olowalu Area (Mile 13-15)**
- **Location:** About 5 miles before Lahaina
- **Why it floods:** Streams from mountains cross under the highway
- **Visual cues:** Olowalu General Store on the right side, debris (branches, mud) on road
- **Action:** Watch for muddy water crossing pavement

### General Storm Driving Rules:

**Before You Leave Airport:**
1. **Check road conditions** — Ask rental car staff: "Is Highway 30 open? Any flooding?"
2. **Check radar** — Use Windy app or Hawaii News Now website
3. **Have backup plan ready** — Save airport hotel phone number: Courtyard Marriott Kahului (808-871-1800)
4. **Test wipers and headlights** in rental car before leaving lot

**While Driving:**
1. **Turn on headlights** (required by law when wipers are on)
2. **Slow down** — Drive 10-15 mph under speed limit
3. **Increase following distance** — 4-5 seconds behind car ahead
4. **Use two hands** — Wind gusts can push the car
5. **Stay in right lane** except when passing — Easier to pull over if needed
6. **Watch brake lights ahead** — Cars slowing = hazard ahead
7. **If visibility drops below 100 feet, pull over safely** — Turn on flashers, wait for rain band to pass

**Hydroplaning Prevention:**
- If car feels like it's floating or steering gets light:
  - **Don't brake!** Take foot off gas
  - **Steer straight** until tires regain traction
  - **Slow down naturally**
- Avoid sudden movements (steering, braking, accelerating)

**Flash Flood Safety:**
- **Turn around, don't drown** — Most storm deaths are from driving into water
- If you see water on road: Can you see the road surface beneath it? No? Don't cross.
- **6 inches of water can stall most cars**
- **12 inches of water can float most cars**
- If your car stalls in water, abandon it immediately and get to high ground

### Visual Cues That It's Safe to Drive:

✅ Other cars moving at normal speeds (40-50 mph)
✅ Can see 200+ feet ahead
✅ Rain is moderate (can see brake lights clearly)
✅ No standing water on highway
✅ No emergency vehicles with lights flashing

### Visual Cues to WAIT or Seek Alternate Route:

🛑 Cars stopped or pulled over with flashers on
🛑 Visibility less than 50-100 feet
🛑 Water flowing ACROSS the road (not just puddles)
🛑 Debris on road (branches, rocks, mud)
🛑 Brown/muddy water = flash flood runoff
🛑 Emergency vehicles blocking lanes
🛑 Can't see road lane markings

### Backup Plans if Conditions Are Dangerous:

**Option 1: Wait it out**
- Storms come in bands — heavy rain, then breaks, then heavy again
- Pull into Costco parking lot or Ma'alaea Harbor Shops
- Wait 30-60 minutes for the worst to pass
- Storm warning expires at 6 PM

**Option 2: Skip Costco today**
- Drive straight from airport to Ka'anapali (saves 15 min exposure)
- Do Costco run on Day 2 morning when weather improves
- Pick up basics at airport if needed (water, snacks)

**Option 3: Stay near airport overnight**
- Check into Courtyard Marriott Kahului or Maui Beach Hotel
- Drive to Ka'anapali on Day 2 morning (weather will be better)
- Call Eldorado to explain late arrival: (808) 661-0021

### Reality Check:

**Thousands of tourists drive this route daily, even in rain.** Highway 30 is the main artery to West Maui resorts and rarely closes. The route is well-maintained, mostly coastal (not mountainous), and doesn't cross major rivers.

**Your advantages:**
- Midday driving (better visibility than night)
- You'll be cautious and prepared
- Storm is forecast to ease by evening
- Modern rental car with good tires

**Biggest risk:** Other drivers (tourists unfamiliar with conditions + locals driving too fast)

**Bottom line:** Drive defensively, watch for standing water at Ma'alaea, and you'll be fine. If in doubt, pull over and wait.

⚠️ **Check conditions before heading out!** Heavy rain and 60 mph wind gusts forecast through 6 PM.

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| 5:00 PM | **Check weather** | Look outside from your lanai. Is it raining? How hard is the wind? |
| 5:00-6:00 PM | **Option A (if weather permits):** Walk to Whaler's Village, quick browse of shops | 5-min walk from Eldorado (covered walkways help) |

| 6:00 PM | **Dinner** | See options below |

**⚠️ SKIP THE BEACH WALK AND SUNSET** — Not safe/enjoyable in 60 mph winds and heavy rain. Save it for Day 2 or 3.

---

## Dinner Options (Weather-Dependent)

**Option A: Leilani's on the Beach** (if you can get there safely)
- **Location:** Whaler's Village, Ka'anapali Beach (5-min walk from Eldorado, partially covered)
- **Vibe:** Oceanfront, casual-upscale, live Hawaiian music

- Eat on your lanai or inside condo
- **Smart choice** if you're exhausted from travel + don't want to deal with storm

## Practical Notes

- **Weather reality check:** This is an UNUSUAL storm system for Maui. Don't let Day 1 set your expectations — Days 3-7 forecast shows beautiful weather (mostly sunny, 20% isolated showers). This passes quickly!
- **Safety first:** If driving in heavy rain, slow down. Visibility can drop quickly. If flooding on roads, turn around.
- **Jet lag/time adjustment:** Hawaii Standard Time (HST) is UTC-10. That's 2 hours behind Pacific, 5 hours behind Eastern. You'll feel it — early bedtime is smart, especially since weather isn't great anyway.
- **Grocery tip:** The full kitchen at the Eldorado is your budget superpower. Making breakfast and packing beach lunches from Costco supplies will save $50-75/day compared to eating every meal out.
- **Beach cabana:** Ask at the front desk about cabana shuttle hours and how it works. The private beach cabana includes lounge chairs, restrooms, shaded area, and towel service.
- **Tomorrow's surf lesson:** Day 2 also has bad weather (60% thunderstorms, 60 mph gusts). **Call surf school tonight or tomorrow AM to reschedule to Day 3 (Wed Feb 11)** — much better conditions!

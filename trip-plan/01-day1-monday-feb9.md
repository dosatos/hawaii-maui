## Practical Notes

- **Weather reality check:** This is an UNUSUAL storm system for Maui. Don't let Day 1 set your expectations — Days 3-7 forecast shows beautiful weather (mostly sunny, 20% isolated showers). This passes quickly!
- **Safety first:** If driving in heavy rain, slow down. Visibility can drop quickly. If flooding on roads, turn around.
- **Jet lag/time adjustment:** Hawaii Standard Time (HST) is UTC-10. That's 2 hours behind Pacific, 5 hours behind Eastern. You'll feel it — early bedtime is smart, especially since weather isn't great anyway.
- **Grocery tip:** The full kitchen at the Eldorado is your budget superpower. Making breakfast and packing beach lunches from Costco supplies will save $50-75/day compared to eating every meal out.
- **Beach cabana:** Ask at the front desk about cabana shuttle hours and how it works. The private beach cabana includes lounge chairs, restrooms, shaded area, and towel service.
- **Tomorrow's surf lesson:** Day 2 also has bad weather (60% thunderstorms, 60 mph gusts). **Call surf school tonight or tomorrow AM to reschedule to Day 3 (Wed Feb 11)** — much better conditions!

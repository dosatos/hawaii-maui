## Practical Notes

- **Jet lag/time adjustment:** Hawaii Standard Time (HST) is UTC-10. That's 2 hours behind Pacific, 5 hours behind Eastern. You'll feel it — consider an early bedtime tonight.
- **Grocery tip:** The full kitchen at the Eldorado is your budget superpower. Making breakfast and packing beach lunches from Costco supplies will save $50-75/day compared to eating every meal out.
- **Beach cabana:** Ask at the front desk about cabana shuttle hours and how it works. The private beach cabana includes lounge chairs, restrooms, shaded area, and towel service.

## World Whale Day Festival Note
Today is the **first day of the 45th Annual World Whale Day Festival** (Feb 9-15). Events are happening around the island all week. You'll have opportunities to participate on Days 6 and 7.

**Theme:** Your home beach, first snorkel, learn to surf

---

## Schedule

### Morning: Black Rock Snorkeling (FREE)

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| 7:30 AM | Breakfast at the condo | Use your Costco supplies — eggs, fruit, toast |
| 8:15 AM | **Beach cabana shuttle** | Take the golf cart to Ka'anapali Beach. Arrive early for calm water. |
| 8:30-11:00 AM | **Snorkel at Black Rock (Pu'u Keka'a)** | Walk to the north end of Ka'anapali Beach |

**Black Rock snorkeling tips:**
- One of Maui's best and most accessible snorkel spots
- Sea turtles are almost guaranteed — look for them near the base of the rock
- Enter from the sandy beach south of the rock, then snorkel along the rock face
- Morning = calmest water, best visibility, most marine life
- You'll see: green sea turtles, parrotfish, triggerfish, surgeonfish, Moorish idols, sometimes octopus
- **Safety:** Stay close to the rock wall. Don't snorkel around the point where currents can be strong. Keep your 9-year-old between you and the rock.
- Cliff jumping from Black Rock is popular but **not recommended for a 9-year-old**

### Afternoon: Beginner Surf Lesson

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-3:00 PM | **Family surf lesson** | Ka'anapali/Lahaina area. See details below. |
| 3:30 PM | Return to Eldorado | Pool time, rinse off, relax |
| 5:00 PM | Walk to Whaler's Village | |

**Surf Lesson Details:**
- **Duration:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Cost:** ~$100-150 per person (group lesson) or ~$200-250 for private
- **Where:** Multiple surf schools operate at Ka'anapali and nearby beaches. Look for:
  - **Royal Hawaiian Surf Academy** (Ka'anapali)
  - **Maui Surfer Girls** (if your daughter wants a girls-focused experience)
  - **Goofy Foot Surf School** (Lahaina)
- **Good for a 9-year-old?** Absolutely. This is the ideal age. Instructors are experienced with kids and most children stand up on the board within the first lesson.
- **What's included:** Board, rash guard, instruction. Just bring swimsuit and sunscreen.
- **Book 1-2 weeks ahead** for February
- **Alternative:** If surf conditions aren't right or your daughter prefers, swap for a **kayak + snorkel tour** instead (~$80-120/person, 2-3 hrs, paddle along the coast and snorkel with turtles)

**Hula Grill:**
- **Location:** Whaler's Village, Ka'anapali Beach (walkable)
- **Vibe:** Open-air, toes-in-the-sand barefoot bar area, or upstairs dining
- **Why:** Hawaii-inspired dishes, fresh seafood, great ocean views
- **For the kid:** Good keiki menu — wood-fired pizzas, fish & chips, chicken tenders
- **Don't miss:** The macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi; Hula Pie for dessert (ice cream in an Oreo cookie crust — massive, share it)

- **Reservation:** Recommended for dinner. Book on OpenTable.

## Practical Notes

- **Snorkel gear:** If you bought sets at Costco yesterday, bring them today. Otherwise, rent from Snorkel Bob's in Lahaina (~$10-15/day).
- **Sunscreen timing:** Apply reef-safe sunscreen 15 minutes before entering the water. Reapply after swimming. The Maui sun is intense — your first day in the water is when burns happen most.
- **After-sun care:** If anyone gets pink, apply aloe vera gel tonight.

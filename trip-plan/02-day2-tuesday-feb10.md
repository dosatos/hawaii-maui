## Practical Notes

- **This is NOT a typical Maui day:** Don't be discouraged. The forecast for Days 3-7 is excellent (mostly sunny, 20% isolated showers, normal trade winds).
- **Stay flexible:** Have multiple backup plans. Check weather every few hours.
- **Safety:** Do NOT attempt snorkeling if ocean is rough. Don't try to swim in 60 mph winds.
- **Surf school:** Confirm the reschedule to Wednesday. Most schools are understanding about weather.
- **Silver lining:** This is a good "rest day" after travel. Catch up on sleep, relax, don't feel pressure to do anything major.
- **Tomorrow (Day 3) will be MUCH better:** 78°F, only 20% rain, winds 20 mph (perfect for surfing!)

## Practical Notes

- **Snorkeling timing:** Morning (8:00-11:00 AM) has the best water conditions — calm winds, flat water, best visibility
- **Ulua Beach parking:** Small lot fills up by 9:30-10:00 AM. Arrive by 8:45 AM if doing Option B
- **Sunscreen reapplication:** You'll be in the water for 2 hours. Reapply reef-safe sunscreen every 90 minutes
- **Driving tip:** The drive from Ka'anapali to South Maui goes through the Ma'alaea area on Highway 30. It's scenic (ocean views, sometimes whales visible from the road!) but can be slow in afternoon traffic heading back. Allow extra time for the return drive.
- **McGregor Point:** On the drive between Ma'alaea and Ka'anapali, there's a lookout on the left side of the road (heading north back). One of the best whale-watching spots on Maui. Worth a 5-min stop on the way back if you have time before the luau.
- **Hydration:** South Maui is the driest part of Maui. Bring plenty of water from the condo.
- **Lunch portions:** Don't eat too much at lunch — save your appetite for the massive luau feast!
- **Luau arrival:** Arrive at 5:15 PM (when gates open) to get the best seats within your seating category and enjoy all pre-show activities

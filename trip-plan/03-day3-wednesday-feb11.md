### Afternoon: Choose Your Adventure

**Option A: Big Beach (Makena) — Scenic Visit**

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2:30 PM | **Drive to Big Beach** | 15 min south from Kihei |
| 2:45-4:00 PM | Walk, wade, photos | Stunning wide golden beach |

- One of Maui's most beautiful beaches — wide, dramatic, feels remote
- **DO NOT SWIM HERE.** Dangerous shore break causes serious injuries every year, especially for kids. The waves look fun but they slam you into the sand.
- Great for: walking, wading at the water's edge, photos, watching bodysurfers
- The view looking south along the coast is spectacular
- Facilities: portable restrooms, dirt parking lot

**Option B: Ulua Beach — More Snorkeling**

|------|----------|---------|
| 2:30 PM | **Drive to Ulua Beach** (Wailea) | 10 min south from Kihei |
| 2:45-4:00 PM | Snorkeling | One of the best in South Maui |

- Rocky reef between Ulua and Mokapu beaches is excellent for snorkeling
- Sea turtles, tropical fish, sometimes octopus
- Sandy entry, then snorkel along the reef edges
- Small parking lot — arrives early or you won't get a spot (easier in the afternoon when morning visitors leave)
- No lifeguards

**Monkeypod Kitchen:**
- **Location:** 10 Wailea Gateway Pl, Wailea (at the Wailea Gateway Center)
- **Vibe:** Upscale-casual. Open-air, lively. Locally focused farm-to-table menu.
- **Why:** Chef Peter Merriman — one of the pioneers of Hawaii Regional Cuisine. Everything is locally sourced. One of the best meals you'll have on Maui.

## Practical Notes

- **Post-surf care:** Your arms and shoulders will be sore from paddling! That's normal. Gentle stretching helps.
- **Sunscreen reapplication:** You'll be in the water a lot today. Reapply reef-safe sunscreen every 90 minutes or after each swim.
- **Driving tip:** The drive from Ka'anapali to South Maui goes through the Ma'alaea area on Highway 30. It's scenic (ocean views, sometimes whales visible from the road!) but can be slow in afternoon traffic heading back. Allow extra time for the return drive.
- **McGregor Point:** On the drive between Ma'alaea and Ka'anapali, there's a lookout on the left side of the road (heading south). One of the best whale-watching spots on Maui. Worth a 5-min stop.
- **Hydration:** South Maui is the driest part of Maui. Bring plenty of water from the condo.

| 11:00 AM-1:00 PM | **Snorkel at Kapalua Bay** | THE BEST family snorkeling on Maui |

**Kapalua Bay — Why it's THE BEST:**

**Snorkeling tips:**
- Enter from the sandy beach in the center
- Snorkel along the rocky left (south) side for turtles

**Flatbread Company:**

## Practical Notes

- **Snorkeling timing:** Midday (10:30 AM-1:00 PM) is a good window — avoids early morning crowds but still gets good visibility
- **Kapalua Bay parking:** Easier to find parking 10:30 AM-1 PM than early morning (when it fills by 8-9 AM)
- **Sunscreen:** Reapply reef-safe sunscreen every 90 minutes while snorkeling
- **'Iao Valley weather:** It's a rainforest valley — expect occasional rain. Bring light rain jacket and wear shoes with good traction (can be slippery when wet).
- **'Iao Valley parking:** Small lot. If full, there's overflow parking at the nearby baseball field (short walk).
- **Pa'ia:** Completely optional today. If you're tired, skip it and rest up for tomorrow's Road to Hana.
- **Gas tip:** Fill up today — Road to Hana tomorrow requires a full tank
- **Early to bed:** Road to Hana tomorrow is 12-14 hours. Get good sleep tonight!

- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours
- **Difficulty:** Easy 0.6-mile paved trail, very kid-friendly, suitable for all ages
- **Best time:** Morning (less crowded) or mid-afternoon

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|

| 7:30 PM | Drive back to Ka'anapali | ~40-50 min |

**Flatbread Company:**
- **Location:** 89 Hana Hwy, Pa'ia
- **Vibe:** Cozy, community-focused, wood-fired oven as the centerpiece
- **Why:** Creative wood-fired flatbread pizzas using local, organic ingredients. Tuesday nights are sometimes "benefit nights" for local causes.
- **For the kid:** The cheese pizza is excellent. Also: pepperoni, or the "Mopsy" (roasted veggies).
- **Don't miss:** The "Punctuated Equilibrium" (sweet local onion, roasted garlic, organic herbs, goat cheese) or whatever the daily special is.
- **Price:** $$ (~$40-60 for a family of 3)
- **Reservation:** Recommended for dinner, especially in peak season. Call ahead.

## Practical Notes

- **Surf lesson decision:** Make this call based on how you're feeling after yesterday's full day (snorkeling + luau). The forecast is excellent for surfing, but it's also okay to skip it and have a relaxed morning.
- **'Iao Valley weather:** It's a rainforest valley — expect occasional rain. Bring light rain jacket and wear shoes with good traction (can be slippery when wet).
- **'Iao Valley parking:** Small lot. If full, there's overflow parking at the nearby baseball field (short walk).
- **Pa'ia parking:** Can be tight on the main street. There's a free public lot behind the shops. If full, there's more parking along Baldwin Avenue.
- **Timing Pa'ia:** Going in the late afternoon is smart — morning Pa'ia is crowded with Road to Hana traffic. By 4-5 PM, it's mellowed out.
- **Gas tip:** Fill up in Kahului on the way to Pa'ia if needed. Pa'ia has limited gas stations.
- **Flexibility:** If you're tired after 'Iao Valley, consider skipping Pa'ia and heading back to the condo for a relaxed evening. You have a BIG day tomorrow (Road to Hana).

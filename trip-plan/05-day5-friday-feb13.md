## Important Road to Hana Tips

### Do NOT attempt the "back side" loop
The unpaved section past Hana toward Kaupo/Ulupalakua is rough, remote, and prohibited by most rental car agreements. Turn around at Hana and come back the way you came.

### Mile markers
The road uses mile markers starting at 0 in Kahului. Most stops are referenced by mile marker number. The Shaka Guide app helps with this.

### Drive defensively
- Pull over at marked turnouts to let faster drivers pass
- Honk before blind curves on one-lane bridges
- Don't stop in the middle of the road
- Yield to oncoming traffic at one-lane bridges (whoever arrives first has right-of-way)

### Manage expectations
The "Road to Hana" is more about the journey than the destination. Hana itself is just a small town. The magic is in the stops along the way.

### Check the weather
If there's been heavy rain, some stops may be closed or unsafe (flash floods). Check mauinow.com the morning of your drive.

### Gas
Fill up completely in Pa'ia. There's a gas station in Hana, but it's expensive and not always open. You should have enough gas to make it back to Pa'ia.

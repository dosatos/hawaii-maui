## Practical Notes

- **This is your longest day:** You'll be awake 20+ hours (3 AM - 11 PM). Pace yourselves. Naps in the afternoon are acceptable.
- **Altitude sickness:** The summit is 10,023 feet. Some people feel lightheaded or nauseous. Stay hydrated, move slowly, and descend if anyone feels unwell.
- **Drive carefully:** The road to Haleakala is steep and winding. Use lower gears on the descent to save your brakes. Watch for cyclists (downhill bike tours are popular).
- **Gas:** Fill up the day before. There are no gas stations on the way up.
- **No food at the summit:** The visitor center doesn't have a café. Bring snacks.

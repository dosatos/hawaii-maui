## Practical Notes

- **Snorkeling timing:** Early morning (8:00-10:30 AM) is best — calm water, good visibility, before wind picks up
- **Parking:** If doing Kapalua, arrive by 7:45 AM for parking. Honolua and Napili are easier.
- **Get there before rain:** Sunday is forecast to be rainy, so this is your last good snorkeling opportunity!
- **Sunscreen:** Reapply reef-safe sunscreen frequently
- **Hydration:** Bring plenty of water for the beach and festival
- **Festival:** It's free, casual, and family-friendly. Stay as long as you want.

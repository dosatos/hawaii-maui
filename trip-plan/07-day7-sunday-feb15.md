**Snorkeling tips:**
- **Best time:** 7:30-10:00 AM — calmest water, best visibility before wind picks up
- Enter from the sandy beach in the center
- Snorkel along the rocky left (south) side for turtles
- Stay inside the bay — don't go around the points where currents get strong
- **Parking:** ~25 public spaces. Arrive by 8 AM or you won't get a spot. No street parking.

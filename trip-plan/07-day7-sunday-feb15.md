| 12:00 PM | **Atlantis Submarine departure** | Check in 30 min before |
| ~2:00 PM | Return to Lahaina Harbor | Total experience ~2 hours |

**Atlantis Submarine — What to Expect:**

This is a **real submarine** — not a glass-bottom boat, not a semi-sub. A genuine 48-passenger Coast Guard-certified submarine that dives to **100-130 feet** below the surface.

**The experience:**
1. Board a surface vessel at Lahaina Harbor
2. Short boat ride (~10 min) to the dive site offshore
3. Transfer to the submarine (climb down a nearly vertical 10-step ladder)
4. Descend to 100-130 feet depth
5. View coral reef, tropical fish, sea turtles, and possibly sharks through large portholes
6. Narrated by the crew — learn about the marine life you're seeing
7. Ascend and transfer back to the surface vessel
8. Boat ride back to harbor

**Key details:**
- **Cost:** $179/adult, $80/child (12 & under)
- **Total family cost:** ~$438
- **Height requirement:** Must be 36 inches tall (your 9-year-old is fine)
- **Duration:** ~2 hours total (including boat transfers)
- **Departure times:** 9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, 1 PM, 2 PM
- **Your departure:** **12:00 PM (Sunday, Feb 15)**
- **Operating days:** 4-5 days/week from Lahaina Harbor (confirm when booking)
- **Safety record:** 38+ years of operation, 580,000+ safe dives, 18 million+ passengers worldwide
- **Motion sickness:** The submarine itself is very stable underwater. The surface boat transfers are short. Most people don't get seasick.
- **Book at:** [atlantisadventures.com/maui](https://www.atlantisadventures.com/maui)
- **Book 1-2 weeks ahead** for February

**Tips:**
- **PERFECT FOR RAINY DAY** — You'll be 100 feet underwater, rain doesn't matter!
- Midday time slots are fine for visibility (mornings are slightly better, but 12 PM is still excellent)
- Wear comfortable clothes — no swimsuit needed, you don't get wet
- Bring a camera — you can photograph through the portholes
- The ladder in/out is the trickiest part for kids. Your 9-year-old should be fine, but practice climbing a ladder if she's nervous.
- Bring light rain jackets for walking from car to harbor in the rain

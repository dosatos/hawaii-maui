## Schedule

### Morning: Kapalua Bay Snorkeling

| Time | Activity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| 7:00 AM | Breakfast at the condo | Light breakfast — eggs, toast, fruit |
| 7:30 AM | **Drive to Kapalua Bay** | 15 min north from Ka'anapali Eldorado |
| 7:45 AM | Arrive (EARLY for parking) | Small lot fills by 9 AM |
| 8:00-10:30 AM | **Snorkel at Kapalua Bay** | Best family snorkeling on Maui |

**Kapalua Bay — Why it's special:**
- **Protected crescent bay** — Rocky headlands on both sides block ocean swells, making it calm even when other beaches have waves
- **Consistent conditions** — One of the most reliably calm snorkel spots
- **Sea turtles almost guaranteed** — Usually spotted along the rocky edges
- **Sandy entry** — Easy for kids
- **Clear water** — Excellent visibility
- **Abundant marine life** — Parrotfish, surgeonfish, tangs, wrasses, butterflyfish, sometimes octopus
- **Shallow reef** — 5-15 feet deep, perfect for a 9-year-old

**Snorkeling tips:**
- **Best time:** 7:30-10:00 AM — calmest water, best visibility before wind picks up
- Enter from the sandy beach in the center
- Snorkel along the rocky left (south) side for turtles
- Stay inside the bay — don't go around the points where currents get strong
- **Parking:** ~25 public spaces. Arrive by 8 AM or you won't get a spot. No street parking.
- **Facilities:** Public restrooms and outdoor showers at the beach access

**Safety:**
- No lifeguards
- Watch your daughter closely — the rocks can be sharp
- Rash guards recommended (sun protection + minor scrape protection)

|------|----------|---------|
| 12:00 PM | **Atlantis Submarine departure** | Check in 30 min before |
| ~2:00 PM | Return to Lahaina Harbor | Total experience ~2 hours |

**Atlantis Submarine — What to Expect:**

This is a **real submarine** — not a glass-bottom boat, not a semi-sub. A genuine 48-passenger Coast Guard-certified submarine that dives to **100-130 feet** below the surface.

**The experience:**
1. Board a surface vessel at Lahaina Harbor
2. Short boat ride (~10 min) to the dive site offshore
3. Transfer to the submarine (climb down a nearly vertical 10-step ladder)
4. Descend to 100-130 feet depth
5. View coral reef, tropical fish, sea turtles, and possibly sharks through large portholes
6. Narrated by the crew — learn about the marine life you're seeing
7. Ascend and transfer back to the surface vessel
8. Boat ride back to harbor

**Key details:**
- **Cost:** $179/adult, $80/child (12 & under)
- **Total family cost:** ~$438
- **Height requirement:** Must be 36 inches tall (your 9-year-old is fine)
- **Duration:** ~2 hours total (including boat transfers)
- **Departure times:** 9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, 1 PM, 2 PM
- **Your departure:** **12:00 PM (Sunday, Feb 15)**
- **Operating days:** 4-5 days/week from Lahaina Harbor (confirm when booking)
- **Safety record:** 38+ years of operation, 580,000+ safe dives, 18 million+ passengers worldwide
- **Motion sickness:** The submarine itself is very stable underwater. The surface boat transfers are short. Most people don't get seasick.
- **Book at:** [atlantisadventures.com/maui](https://www.atlantisadventures.com/maui)
- **Book 1-2 weeks ahead** for February

**Tips:**
- Midday time slots are fine for visibility (mornings are slightly better, but 12 PM is still excellent)
- Wear comfortable clothes — no swimsuit needed, you don't get wet
- Bring a camera — you can photograph through the portholes
- The ladder in/out is the trickiest part for kids. Your 9-year-old should be fine, but practice climbing a ladder if she's nervous.

## Practical Notes

- **Perfect timing:** Kapalua snorkeling ends 10:30 AM → 15 min drive to Lahaina → arrive 11:30 AM for 12:00 PM submarine departure. The timing works perfectly!
- **Kapalua parking:** Arrive by 7:45 AM for parking (only ~25 spaces, fills by 9 AM). This is CRITICAL.
- **Pacing:** This is your last full day. You've been go-go-go all week. The afternoon is intentionally light — rest, pack, enjoy the resort.
- **Packing:** Use the afternoon to pack for tomorrow's departure. Lay out clothes, check for lost items around the condo, organize souvenirs.
- **Gas:** Fill up today so you're not rushed tomorrow morning before your flight.
- **Skipping the parade:** The World Whale Day Parade (typically 11 AM-1 PM in South Kihei) conflicts with the submarine timing. You'd be rushing and stressed. Kapalua snorkeling + submarine is a better use of your last full day.
- **Early to bed:** You have check-out and airport tomorrow morning. Get to bed early tonight.

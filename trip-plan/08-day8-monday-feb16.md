## Breakfast Option: The Gazebo

If you want to end the trip with one more iconic Maui experience, go to **The Gazebo** at Napili Shores for their famous macadamia nut pancakes.

**The Gazebo:**
- **Location:** Napili Shores Resort, 5315 Lower Honoapiilani Rd, Napili (10 min north of Eldorado)

- **Famous for:** Macadamia nut pancakes — huge, fluffy, loaded with mac nuts, served with coconut syrup
- **Other good picks:** Fried rice, omelets, Portuguese sausage
- **Price:** $ (~$10-15/person)
- **The catch:** **No reservations.** First-come, first-served. Expect a 30-60 min wait on a Monday morning.
- **Strategy:** Arrive by 6:45-7:00 AM before they open (they open at 7:30 AM). Get in the first seating. You'll be done by 8:00 AM.
- **Hours:** 7:30 AM - 2:00 PM daily

**Is it worth it?**
- If your flight is after 2 PM: YES, absolutely. Start a food tradition for your family.
- If your flight is before noon: Skip it. Eat at the condo and don't stress about timing.

**Alternative:**
- Make a quick breakfast at the condo with your remaining Costco supplies
- Coffee and pastries to-go from a local coffee shop
